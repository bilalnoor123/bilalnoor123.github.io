										<h2 class="major">About me </h2>
										<p> I am a first-year computer science student studying in the UK, where I am building a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development. Alongside my academic studies, I am passionate about maintaining a balanced lifestyle, playing football regularly, and going to the gym to stay fit. My commitment to both academics and fitness helps me stay disciplined, manage my time effectively, and approach problem-solving with a healthy, active mindset—skills that I also apply in my programming projects and studies.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Currently learning</h2>
										<p> I am currently learning SQL, C++, and JavaScript as part of my university studies, where I am gaining a strong understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of these languages. With SQL, I am exploring database design, querying, and data manipulation, which are essential for managing and analyzing large datasets. In C++, I am diving into core programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, and performance optimization, helping me develop a solid foundation for low-level system programming. Meanwhile, through JavaScript, I am building my web development skills, learning how to create dynamic, interactive websites, and understanding the intricacies of front-end and back-end integration. These languages are giving me a well-rounded skill set, which is enabling me to tackle a wide variety of programming challenges across different domains of software development.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Fun fact about me </h2>
										<p>I have the complete collection of the Harry Potter books, spanning all seven titles from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Each book is a cherished part of my collection, and I’ve enjoyed reading them multiple times, immersing myself in J.K. Rowling’s richly detailed world of magic, friendship, and adventure. Over the years, I’ve accumulated various editions, including special hardcovers, illustrated versions, and collector's editions, which make the collection even more meaningful to me. The series has not only sparked my imagination but also deepened my appreciation for storytelling and character development, influencing both my personal interests and academic pursuits</p>

											<h3 class="major">Project 1</h3>
											<p> Currently i am working on a sql database using apex oracle to make a database. The scenario involved Creating an SQL database for a local restaurant involves designing a relational database that organizes and stores key information essential for daily operations. The goal is to structure the data in a way that ensures efficient access, easy updates, and secure management of restaurant activities.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/Picture2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Project 2</h3>
											<p> I have been making c++ projects because creating C++ projects is a powerful way to deepen my understanding of the language and enhance my programming skills. By building real-world projects, I can apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context, improving both my problem-solving abilities and coding efficiency. I can start with small, manageable projects, such as a simple calculator, to-do list manager, or text-based game, which will help me master core C++ concepts like variables, loops, functions, and conditionals. As I gain confidence, you can progressively tackle more complex projects that introduce advanced topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and data structures.<p>

											<h3 class="major">Project 3</h3>
											<p> I have made a website for swimming pool using html,css and javascript to further improve upon my website creation skills. This is how it was achieved, Creating a website for a swimming pool business involves designing a user-friendly, visually appealing platform that showcases the pool’s services, amenities, and features while making it easy for potential customers to learn more and make bookings. The first step is to focus on the design and layout, ensuring the website is clean, modern, and responsive, meaning it adapts well to both desktop and mobile devices. The homepage should highlight the pool’s key selling points, such as its size, location, facilities (e.g., heated water, diving boards, or children’s areas), and any special features like spa or sauna services.<p>

											<h3 class="major">Project 4</h3>
											<p> I have been making python projects because Creating Python projects is one of the most effective ways to deepen your understanding of the language and improve my problem-solving skills. Python is widely recognized for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and more experienced programmers. By working on real-world projects, I can apply what you've learned in a practical context, helping to reinforce core programming concepts and expand your knowledge in areas such as data structures, algorithms, and libraries.<p>
